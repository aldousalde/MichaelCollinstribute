          milestone... <br> <br>Michael remained a tireless promoter of space... <br> <br>His own signature
          accomplishments, his writings about his experiences, and his leadership of the National Air and Space Museum
          helped gain wide exposure for the work of all the men and women who have helped our nation push itself to
          greatness in aviation and space. There is no doubt he inspired a new generation of scientists, engineers, test
          pilots, and astronauts. <br><br>...Whether his work was behind the scenes or on full view, his legacy will
          always be as one of the leaders who took America's first steps into the cosmos. And his spirit will go with us
          as we venture toward farther horizons.” <br> <br>--NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk</blockquote>
